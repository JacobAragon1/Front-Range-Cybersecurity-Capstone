This is my final project for my capstone project at Front Range Community College. A few other students created an infrastucture for a mock pharmaceutical company.
We configured several servers and were given data to implement in a active directory environment. We then had to configure the network map so the servers were
protected within the network and they upheld confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
